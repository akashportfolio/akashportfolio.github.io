                    <p>I am heavily involved in Civil Air Patrol, which is an auxiliary of the United States Air Force. In this program I was tasked to leading groups of over 20 people. I was also tasked in handling documents such as notes, attendance, and forms for various activities. Civil Air Patrol has taught me many core values such as Leadership and Integrity. This program has grew me into a leader who will not back down at any tasks. 
        I am also involved in Boy Scouts of America. I am currently a Life Scout, and almost an Eagle. This program was another opportunity for me to grow as a leader. It also taught me how to manage myself in the toughest situations. From surviving in the woods to leading a group of kids, Boy Scouts have allowed me to grow as a person and a leader.
        Aside from my outside of school activities, I am also heavily involved in my school. I am the co-founder of two STEM related clubs in my school. I have co-founded a Robotics Team that has competed in both regional and international levels. It is comprised of five V.E.X teams and one Elite F.I.R.S.T Team. Aside from robotics I have co-founded an Invention Club at my school. One of our competitions we entered was the M.I.T InvenTeams. Our team was selected to compete for a ten-thousand dollar grant. We are really excited to engage our fellow peers into the opportunity filled world of STEM education.</p>

                    <p><br>The inspiration for this piece came from my change of view on my life overall, something I will discuss in further depth in my personal reflection on the year. I have started to think about my purpose in life and what I have to offer, and I couldn’t really come up with an answer that I was satisfied with. Instead I wanted to think of an answer that would help to answer the purpose of life overall. I had some difficulty answering this question but instead of answering this question based on religion or spirituality, I answered it based on facts and my personal views. I appreciate facts and proof opposed to fictitious stories to answer the meaning of life, and I expressed this in my piece. I had many interpretations of this piece before, however as time evolved so did my views, and so did this piece accordingly. I also reached out to my friends for feedback and adjusted my piece to better represent what I wanted to say. However I made sure to keep my point of view, and I did not try to please anyone. This is one of the first pieces that I wrote about what was on my mind, and not what I needed to write for an assignment. I thoroughly enjoyed writing this piece, mainly because it provided me with relief and way to write about my views on life, something I’ve never really thought about doing before. The hardest aspect of this piece was conveying my thoughts on paper, I had difficulty organizing my thoughts in a manner that my readers would understand what I was trying to say. With the difficulty of organization, I also had trouble allowing my piece to flow as one fluid statement. I fixed this by choosing the way I presented my arguments. In addition, I had difficulty choosing whether to present my piece in a traditional essay format or format it as a personal voice. I chose the traditional format to better credit my points. I chose to feature this piece because I believe that it best represents my ideologies and my changed perspective. </p>

                    <p><br>The inspiration for this piece came from my everyday experiences and things I notice as I go to school everyday. The first thing that annoyed me ,the lack of action on atrocities happening everyday, was inspired from my first piece regarding purpose. I thought no matter how well we do in school and go to a good college we still won’t be affecting anyone else except us. Even the effect on us will have no impact on others, and basically we will be forgotten in a few decades. However, if we choose to do something with the knowledge we gain, it would mean much more, and that is why I choose to write about the first struggle. I feel that there are too many people uneducated  about the conflicts that are happening around the world, and I believe that our school system is not going a good job in teaching that. This piece was my thoughts on that issue and other school related issues. Since I been South Brunswick High School for about the majority of my late teens, I thought it would be a good idea to address some issues I have come upon in my everyday experience. I usually think about these issues a lot, but I never bothered to express them to others, I just kept it to my self. However this piece gave me an opportunity to express my feelings on various topics, such as group assignments, school lunches, and the way kids are taught. I especially loved writing about my views on how children are taught. Most of our education system stresses on direct testing, and promotes memorizing facts for a single test. However I opposed this by saying there should be assessments in which students are tested on their application of the material. This sort of testing will require the students to know the facts and understand what they are reading so that they can apply it to various situations. I also expressed how I despise those who make judgments on others based on their grades. Grades is not by any means a proper way to judge a person’s intelligence, or character. I really enjoyed this piece, and I feel like I did well covering the major conflicts that I wish I could amend.</p>

                    <p><br>I choose to include this as one of my four most memorable pieces because I believe that it best represents my development as a writer. To actually see how much I developed, I read my summer assignment and read the essay after and I was proud of how much I have improved. I have gone to just describing what happened in the book, and using the crappiest textual evidence, to analyzing the story for a deeper meaning and using the novel to prove it. I also learned how to include a personal voice in my works. Before, I always thought there is one definite answer that the grader is looking for, however I quickly learned that that was not the answer. I now write about what I want to write about, and make connections about what I want to connect it to. However doing this was not easy. I had to learn how to input my perspective while also being accurate and professional. I had to use the novel as evidence to support what I had to say, and throughout the year I developed this skill. I believe that this essay  really represents me as a writer. Some difficulties I faced was developing a proper argument. Even though this was our final essay, I still have trouble developing a proper argument. However through my editing ad work I believe I got it right. I also believe that I used proper textual evidence and analyzed it so that it would help support my argument without changing the meaning. I also believe I did a good job in addressing my topic directly and not providing any ‘fluff’, in most of my works before this year I wrote a lot of fluff that didn't relate to the topic just to fulfill the page requirement. However now I struggle to keep in the page limit, I have so much to write about my topic that I have to pick what will best represent it. This was not a problem that I faced before, and I am actually happy that I have so much to write about. Before, I used to despise writing essays about novels we read in class. However, once given the opportunity to write about what I want and allow me to put my perspective, I really started to enjoy writing these analytic essays. Something I thought I would never say. </p>

                    <p><br>This piece is not a school assignment or anything that should be familiar to anyone. In fact it is quite odd, but it is something I am extremely proud of. It is a procedure that I have made to gather new participants for a program called Civil Air Patrol, which is an auxiliary of the Air Force. It is a program that I have been involved in for three years. The reason I choose to include this odd piece is because it represents my most memorable work done at the program. The program in itself has taught me how to uphold excellence in all I do, and how to be a great leader. The motivation for this procedure chosen, was a task from my senior mentor. He asked me to create a program that will gather the interest of  new students and have them go to a class that will have them trained to be a new cadet. This involves teaching the principles of C.A.P, which is very similar to Air Force traditions. I was honored that my mentor gave me such an important task, and I promised my whole commitment to making this program successful. I created a six-week in depth course that turned a new student into a well-trained cadet. This program was called the Training Flight. This whole process allowed me to show-off what I have been learning for the past three years and exhibit my leadership skills. Now I am in charge of over 15 Cadets, and new student come every week. This procedure was written to improve the process of admitting the student into the Training Flight, and make sure they feel welcome. Prior to this project I was not a very social person and got nervous at the thought of teaching lessons to over ten people. However, once I got the satisfaction of seeing Cadets graduate from my program and succeeding in their C.A.P. careers I was ecstatic.  Now I  can’t wait to teach these students and spread my knowledge. I have also learned how to delegate tasks and work with a team to accomplish a goal. This program has stimulated the hierarchy of a corporate company, and how to follow it.  This project has opened many doors, and it is one of the most memorable things I have done this year.</p>
